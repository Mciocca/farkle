Farkle
======

This is the the dice game [Farkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle) built on sinatra with a healthy dose of JavaScript.

Run the game
------------
If you would like to run this game locally:

First, make sure you have Ruby installed. I recommend grabbing Ruby and everything needed to get it up and running in a development environment from [here](http://railsinstaller.org/en). This game should work with Ruby 1.9.3+.

Next clone this repo, `$ cd` to it and run `$ bundle install`. From the main folder of the 
game, run `ruby farkle.rb` and navigate your browser to localhost:4567. Now grab a friend and play farkle!

If your feeling lazy, just play it over on [Heroku](http://radiant-taiga-1258.herokuapp.com/).
